    <h2 id="h-introducing-minecraft">Introducing Minecraft</h2>
    <p>Minecraft is a survival tactic game created by the publisher Mojang. At first, the game has a
      name is Cave Game, then it was renamed Minecraft Order The Stone, and finally, it is Minecraft.
      The game was inspired by several titles such as Dwarf Fortress, Infiniminer, and Roller Coaster
      Tycoon.</p>
    <h3 id="h-interesting-gameplay">Interesting gameplay</h3>
    <p>In Minecraft, the player takes on a character in an open world without a specific goal, allowing
      the player to do what you like freely. Initially, players are in the face of a wilderness world
      with varied terrains such as plains, hills, caves, swamps, deserts, forests, and various water
      bodies. During the game, players will encounter many creatures such as villagers, animals you
      can eat, or make products such as beef, sheep, chicken, fish, and usually appear in the daytime.
    </p>
    <p>The game divides time into day and night according to a given cycle, with a typical cycle of 20
      minutes in real-time. At night, perilous monsters can attack players, such as spiders, zombies,
      or skeletons. Also, the creeper is a particularly dangerous creature that can explode, and it
      Can appear both day and night. Minecraft allows players to use the right tools to dig blocks to
      have varied materials, collect and create everything they want. You can build your own creative
      house or anything, and this is one of the highlights of the game to attract millions of players.
    </p>
    <h3 id="h-building-your-world">Building your world</h3>
    <p>Before the night comes, players must find shelter because darkness will appear with the monsters
      and they will attack you, so initially, you need to dig a cave to get shelter then take
      advantage of the materials to build a house and make enough items. </p>
    <p>Minecraft is simulated as in real life so you can be hungry and have to go for food like chicken,
      pig, cow... In addition to natural food, players can also be a farmer. Getting the land,
      seeding, and reclaiming a large land area so that you can plant trees and harvest food. You can
      also build a farm for animals such as cows, pigs, chickens for meat or take raw materials for
      making shirts, pants...</p>
    <h3 id="h-attractive-modes">Attractive modes</h3>
    <p>In Minecraft, there are game modes such as survival mode, creative mode, and super hard mode.</p>
    <p>In the <strong>survival mode</strong>, players will have to search for resources, build and find
      food. The player has a health bar so you know when he is hungry and when you need to find food.
      Also, if monsters attack us, we will lose our blood, so I think we could stay away from the
      monsters in the cave or the house at night. We can also craft weapons to attack and destroy
      monsters. When killing animals or monsters the player will gain experience, the higher the
      experience points, the better the player will be able to build stronger armor.</p>
    <p><strong>Creative Mode</strong>: In this mode players have all the resources and tools, players
      can create their own way to create a world of great works, go around the world without being
      attacked and die.</p>
    <p><strong>The super-hard mode</strong>: this mode is quite similar to the survival mode, players
      live as real life, only one network to die, then the game will end, cannot return to the
      previous world. This allows us to play with the subtle, suspense, and have the experience as in
      real life.</p>
    <h3 id="h-graphics">Graphics</h3>
    <p>The world of Minecraft all things are made up of 3D cubes with various materials such as earth,
      water, stone, wood, gold... estimated in the game has about 36 million square cubicles. If you
      just glanced through the images in Minecraft then maybe the player would think that this game is
      low quality, made mainly for fun because the graphics look quite classic in modern-day advanced
      graphics. But unlike its appearance, the game with its exciting, creative appeal attracts more
      gamers to love it.</p>
